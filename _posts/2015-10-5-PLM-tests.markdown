description: High mach number piecewise linear tests

What happens if we look at the same two high mach number tests from 
the previous posts (the square wave test and the shock tube test), but
use a piecewise linear reconstruction?

Figure 1a: PLMC, exact solver, no dual energy, $$v \approx 800 c_s$$

Figure 1b: Same as Figure 1a but with dual energy

Figure 2a: PLMP, exact solver, no dual energy, $$v \approx 800 c_s$$
