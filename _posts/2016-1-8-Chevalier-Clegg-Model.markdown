description: The Galactic wind model of Chevalier & Clegg 
---

We need to come up with a reasonable set of parameter space to explore
in studying the environment of the cool material in galactic winds. The 
Chevalier and Clegg wind model (1985) provides a reasonable fit for the 
escaping hot wind, which can be sampled at a variety of radii from the 
galaxy to give a reasonable set of densities, veloicties, and temperatures.

The CC85 model with default parameters is shown below:
