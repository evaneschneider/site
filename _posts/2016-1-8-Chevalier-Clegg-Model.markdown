description: The Galactic wind model of Chevalier & Clegg 
---

We need to come up with a reasonable set of parameter space to explore
in studying the environment of the cool material in galactic winds. The 
Chevalier and Clegg wind model (1985) provides a reasonable fit for the 
escaping hot wind, which can be sampled at a variety of radii from the 
galaxy to give a reasonable set of densities, veloicties, and temperatures.

The CC85 model with default parameters is shown below:

And a version with each variable normalized to the value at $r = 0$:

These parameters include a driving region of size $$R = 200$$ pc, mass input
rate $$\dot{M} = 1.0 \, \mathrm{M}_{\odot} \, \mathrm{yr}^{-1}$$, and energy input rate
$$\dot{E} = 10^{43} \, \mathrm{erg} \, \mathrm{s}^{-1}$$.
