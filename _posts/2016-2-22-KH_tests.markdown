description: Tests of the 2D integration schemes

A high cloud-density 2D sphere-wind simulation with GPU cooling exhibited some strange behavior,
namely the timestep abruptly shrank from ~$$10^{-2}$$ to ~$$10^{-4}$$. I ran the 
sim again with CPU cooling and things seem okay, so maybe there is a bug in the GPU cooling,
but it got me worried about the integration scheme, so I ran some KH tests. I'm not sure if we've
run these before, but I'm a little concerned with the results.
