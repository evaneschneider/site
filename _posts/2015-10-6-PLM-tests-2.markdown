In this post we focus on the high mach number square wave test from 
previous posts, now trying to answer the question - how do we either 
a) come up with a better approximation for the internal energy update 
or b) at least come up with a switch that does not degrade the solution?

Without dual energy, Cholla seems to suffer only from diffusion in these tests, 
which isn't a scenario we expect dual energy to improve. However, we certainly don't 
want to employ a dual energy method that makes the solution worse:

Figure 1: PLMC, exact solver, no dual energy, $$v \approx 800 c_s$$

Figure 2: Same as Figure 1 but with dual energy

Note: Previous versions of Figure 2 looked worse - I found a small bug 
in the internal energy PLMC reconstruction that was allowing non-monotonic 
reconstructions.

**What can we do?**

First, what happens if we get rid of the total energy synchronization?

Figure 3: Same as Figure 2 but without the total energy sync

Now the internal energy update has no effect on the hydrodynamics, so the 
perturbations in the velocity disappear. Similalry, the perturbations in the 
pressure as calculated from the total energy (not shown) also vanish, but the 
pressure as calculated from the internal energy (shown above) is as bad as 
Figure 2, or maybe worse. The internal energy is not very different
between Figure 2 and Figure 3, despite the fact that the inputs to 
the internal energy update (the P, $$v_{i-1}$$, $$v_{i+1}$$ terms, etc.) should 
be different now that they are not getting perturbed. This is probably just because 
the perturbations are small in scale.

What if I only use the advected flux portion of the internal energy update?
