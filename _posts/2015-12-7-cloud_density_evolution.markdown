The following images and plots are products from a cloud-wind simulation with the following parameters:

Resolution: 1024x384x384
Size: 80x30x30 pc
Wind density: $n_{wind} = 0.1 \mathrm{cm}^{-3}$
Wind temperature: $T_{wind} = 5 \times 10^6 \mathrm{K}$
Wind velocity: $v_{wind} = 1200 \mathrm{km} \mathrm{s}^{-1}
Average cloud density: $<n_{cloud}> = 75 \mathrm{cm}^{-3}$
Cloud radius: 5 pc
Cloud mass: 800 $M_{sun}$

Cloud mass is measured as all material with a number density higher than $n = 1.0$.

The following four snapshots show the evolution of the cloud over the first 400,000 years 
of the simulation. Snapshots are spaced 100,000 years apart.

Below is a density pdf showing all the material in the simulation. Lines correspond to the 
four snapshots above, with the color gradient going from darkest (snapshot 0) to lightest 
(snapshot 400k).
