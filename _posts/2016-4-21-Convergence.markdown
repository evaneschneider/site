description: A look at convergence for the sphere tests

The plot below shows the evolution of the mass fraction for the $$n_h = 1$$ sphere-wind simulation at 
four different resolutions. The lowest-resolution sim had 16 cells / $$R_\mathrm{cl}$$, followed
by 32 cells / $$R_\mathrm{cl}$$, 64 cells / $$R_\mathrm{cl}$$, and 128 cells / $$R_\mathrm{cl}$$.
All simulations were run on a grid with physical size $$160\times40\times40$$ pc, except the highest, 
which was run in an $$80\times30\times30$$ pc box, and only until $$t = 200$$ kyr. Lines show
the mass fraction calculated as the fraction of material above 1/20th the intitial median density (solid),
1/10th the initial median density (dashed), and 1/3rd the intial median density (dash-dot).
