description: A comparison of low and high resolution simualtions
---

The plots below compare the $$n_h = 1$$ sphere-wind simulation at 
two different resolutions. The low-resolution sim had 32 cells / $$R_{cloud}$$,
while the high-resolution sim had 64 cells / $$R_{cloud}$$. Both simulations 
were run on a $$2048\times512\times512$$ grid, but the spatial resolution was
6.4 cells / parsec for the low resolution run and 12.8 cells / parsec for the 
high resolution run. The only other difference between the sims was the outer
edge of the cloud density profile, which in the low resolution sim gradually
tapered to a density somewhat higher than the wind density, and in the high 
resolution sim steeply tapered to equal the wind density.
