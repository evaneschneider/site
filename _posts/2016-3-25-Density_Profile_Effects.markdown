description: A comparison of clouds with different density profiles 
---

In the last post I noted that there were clear differences between the 
low and high resolution $$n_h = 1$$ cloud simulations at 200 kyr. However,
the fact that the clouds started with different density profiles and therefore,
different masses was a confounded variable in determining the cause of the
different morphologies. Hence, I have rerun the high resolution simulation 
to 200 kyr with the old density profile. 

The three profiles are compared in the plot below. The low and high resolution
simulations with the old density profile are shown in blue and green, respectively,
and the high resolution simulation with the new profile is shown in red. The plot is
a 1D slice through the center of the cloud, zoomed in on the outer edge.
